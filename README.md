## TL;DR

The fatest way to getting started with Wechaty is to use a Cloud IDE.

If you have no idea about anything, then you should try Gitpod first.

## Getting Started

### 1 Install Node.js (>=12)

If you have not installed Node.js(or version is below 10),You need to install the latest version of Node.js first by following the links below:

- [Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows)
- [Linux(Debian/Ubuntu)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)
- [macOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos)

> Instal Node.js for other platforms can be found at <https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/>

### 2 Clone this Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started.git
cd wechaty-getting-started
```

### 3 Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

#### Troubleshooting

1. You might want to use taobao registry mirror for NPM:

    ```sh
    npm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org install
    ```

1. You mignt need [windows-build-tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tool) if you are using windows:

    ```sh
    npm install windows-build-tools
    ```

### 4 Run the Bot

You can use `export` to set environment variables in Linux, and use `set` in Windows.

#### Linux

```shell
export WECHATY_LOG=verbose
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-wechat
npm start
# the above is equals to the below command:
# npx ts-node examples/ding-dong-bot.ts
```

#### Windows

```shell
set WECHATY_LOG=verbose
set WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-wechat
npm start
# the above is equals to the below command:
# npx ts-node examples/ding-dong-bot.ts
```

You are all set!

## Working with Different Puppets

In our getting started example, the ding-dong BOT is using [wechaty-puppet-wechat4u](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-wechat4u) when `WECHATY_PUPPET` is not set, which is just for newcomer's convenience.

By default, the Wechaty will use the [Puppet Service](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-services/) for logging in your bot. You can use other [Puppet Provider](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet/wiki/Directory) like Whatsapp Web protocol([wechaty-puppet-whatsapp](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-whatsapp)).

If you want to use a Wechaty Puppet Provider for different protocols, then you need to specified a puppet service provider name (the same as its NPM name) by setting the `WECHATY_PUPPET` environment variable.

Thanks for the great contributions from our great community, there are many Wechaty Puppets can be used by Wechaty, which helps us to use protocols like Web, Pad, Mac, and Windows.

### Wechaty Puppets

| Protocol | NPM |
| :--- | :--- |
| Puppet Service | `wechaty-puppet-service` |
| Whatsapp Web | `wechaty-puppet-whatsapp` |
| WeChat Web | `wechaty-puppet-wechat` |
| WeChat Pad | `wechaty-puppet-padlocal` |

> Visit our website for learning more about [Wechaty Puppet Service Providers](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-services/)

For example, if you want to use the `padlocal` puppet, you should set `WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-padlocal` before you run `npm start`.

> You also need a TOKEN for the `wechaty-puppet-padlocal`, and set it to the `WECHATY_PUPPET_PADLOCAL_TOKEN` environment variable. Apply the PadLocal TOKEN from [here](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-services/padlocal/)

### Linux / macOS

```sh
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-padlocal
export WECHATY_PUPPET_PADLOCAL_TOKEN='puppet_padlocal_your-token-here'
npm start
```

### Windows

```sh
set WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-padlocal
set WECHATY_PUPPET_PADLOCAL_TOKEN='puppet_padlocal_your-token-here'
npm start
```

### 2. What is a `Puppet` in Wechaty

The term [Puppet](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty/wiki/Puppet) in Wechaty is an Abstract Class for implementing protocol plugins. The plugins are the component that helps Wechaty to control the Wechat(that's the reason we call it puppet).

The plugins are named `PuppetXXX`, like [PuppetWeChat](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty-puppet-wechat) is using the [google puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to control the [WeChat Web API](https://wx.qq.com) via a chrome browser, [PuppetPadchat](https://github.com/lijiarui/wechaty-puppet-padchat) is using the WebSocket protocol to connect with a Protocol Server for controlling the iPad Wechat program. More detail you could go [Puppet in wiki](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty/wiki/Puppet).
